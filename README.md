# streamlet_rust
Rust implementation of Streamlet consensus protocol, introduced by Benjamin Y. Chan and Elaine Shi [1].\
This is a very minimal codebase, showcasing the protocol, and was implemented as part of research.\
Further improvements should be implemented for a proper deployment.\
<br>
Simulation of the protocol is implemented as a unit test and can be executed using:
```
cargo test -- --nocapture
```
